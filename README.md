- "buffer" = {good: amount} a storage try (1-buffer) to have: slotted = amount of slot, specific = amount per type.
   Once done, modify conveying tests in order to check goods are gone *and* have arrived (with 2 storage, one buffering and begining empty)

# Ideas
Alveolus of 1, 2, 3 tiles.
1- multiply room by 1, 3, 6
2- allow bigger improvements - when a tech is early and expensive
